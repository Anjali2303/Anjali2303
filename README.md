👋  Hi, I’m Anjali Yadav, a machine learning Engineer, pursuing my Masters in Artificial intelligence and Data Science

👀  I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies. From 2018 through 2021 I learnt Python, C, C++. In 2022         till now, I learnt Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Modeling, Statistics and Natural Language Processing.

🌱  Outside of tech too, I love pushing myself to learn new skills ranging from Drumming, Hip Hop and Contemporary Dance and Sketching (aimimg for mastery only in dance      and sketching though).

💞️  I love reading fiction and books on self-improvement. My favourite ones are The Colour Purple by Alice Walker in the genre of fiction and Atomic Habits by James          Clear in the genre of Personal Development.
